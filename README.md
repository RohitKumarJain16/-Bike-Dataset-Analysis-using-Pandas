# 🏍️-Bike-Dataset-Analysis-using-Pandas

This repository contains a beginner-friendly analysis of the Used_Bikes.csv dataset using Pandas, a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis.

📦 What’s Inside:
We explore how to:

• Load the dataset using pd.read_csv()

• View data structure using .info(), .head(), and .shape

• Clean the data by removing duplicates

• Understand the dataset with .describe() for basic statistics

• Check value counts and unique values in categorical columns

🔍 Analysis Highlights:

• Filtered specific bike brands like Royal Enfield and TVS based on price, age, ownership, and kilometers driven.

• Applied Boolean indexing and .query() for clean and readable filtering.

• Analyzed key features like bike brand, price, city, owner type, age, and power.

• Identified top bike brands and ownership distribution using value_counts().

🧰 Key Pandas Concepts Used:
DataFrame and Series

• Filtering with conditions

• Removing duplicates

• Selecting specific columns

• Viewing summary statistics

• Querying data using .query()

This project is a great start for anyone learning data analysis with Pandas and looking to understand how to work with real-world datasets in a structured and efficient way.
